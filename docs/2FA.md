# Setting Up and using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and use 2FA on your account.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have an authenticator app installed on your smartphone. Install one of the following apps:
 - Google Authenticator 
 - Microsoft Authenticator 
 - FreeOTP

### Setting Up Your Authenticator App (Initial Login)

The first time you log in, you will need to set up your authenticator app. Follow the steps below:
1. Log in to your account using the standard username and password.
2. You will be presented with a screen with a QR code (a square barcode image) and potentially a manual entry key. Do not close this window. 
3. Open the authenticator app on your mobile device. 
4. Select the option to "Add an account" or the plus (+) icon within the app. 
5. Choose the option to "Scan a QR code" and point your phone's camera at the QR code on your computer screen. 
   - If you cannot scan the code, select "Enter a setup key manually" in your app and type the code provided on the screen. 
6. Your app will display a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds.
7. Enter this 6-digit code into the field provided on your computer screen. You may also be prompted to enter a device name.
8. Click Submit to complete the setup.

You have now successfully linked your authenticator app to your account.

### Using 2FA for Subsequent Logins

Once 2FA is set up, your login process will have an extra step. Follow the steps below to log in:

1. Go to the login page and enter your username and password as usual. 
2. You will be prompted for a "One-Time Password" (OTP) or "One-time code." 
3. Open your authenticator app on your phone to see the current 6-digit code for this account.
4. Enter the code into the login screen on your computer.
5. Click Sign In to access your account.

### Managing Your 2FA Settings

You can manage your security settings, including your authenticator app and recovery codes, via the account management console.
- Log in and navigate to the **Account Security** or **Signing In section**. Here you can:
  - **Re-configure** your authenticator app if you get a new phone.
  - **Set up** or view **recovery codes**. Store these codes in a safe, offline place. They can be used as a backup if you lose access to your phone.

If you lose your device and do not have recovery codes, please contact support for assistance with resetting your credentials.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with 2FA, consider the following tips:
- Ensure that the time on your mobile device is synchronized correctly, as time discrepancies can cause codes to be invalid.
- If you lose access to your authenticator app, use backup codes if available, or contact support for account recovery options.
- Make sure you are entering the most recent code displayed in your authenticator app.
- If you are not receiving the prompt for the OTP, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser.
